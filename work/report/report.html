                    <b>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</b>
                    <br>Im quite comfortable with Git and Github because we have used it for most of our projects. I myself dont really have problems with git but at times during our projects it did become troublesome. I have used built in frameworks
                    for most our projects though so its quite good that i am "forced" to use commands in git bash again. I had never heard of Markdown or github pages before and it would be nice if we make use of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Have you ever created websites before?</b>
                    <br>Only when i had a small course in it in upper secondary school. I did not particularly like it back then and i hope this course will change that. Other than that i have never continued devoloping anything web based.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</b>
                    <br>Very little experience with html, css, javascript, php coming from courses in upper secondary school. I dont remember much of it since it didnt interest me back then. If it counts i have done a fair share of styling in android
                    development which uses a tree structure like html. I have a very broad interest of IT and development in general. I like both front and back end but of the two i probably enyoy back end more but there are alot of factors involved so
                    sometimes i might enyoy doign the front end more and vice verca.

                    <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                    <br>Being able to test html through Github pages was a quite nice surprise. I had also never forked a repository before. So far i really like the way this course is setup with many mandatory tasks because otherwise i might have become
                    a bit lazy and not practise enough.

                    <b>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or Javascript?</b>
                    <br>Very little experience during my time in upper secondary school. We had a weird sitution with the teacher where he suddenly couldnt work anymore so another teacher took over and basically told us to use https://www.codecademy.com/
                    to learn. It was super boring and is the main reason i have never had any interest in web devolopment. I dont know if its bad memory but i can barely recall anything of css. The things i know now mostly comes from styling in android
                    cause it is kinda similar. This course seem much more promising so far and i enyoy it quite a bit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</b>
                    <br>HTML acts as the structure where things are placed and how you can interact with the different parts. CSS acts as the appearance that decides how things should look. Every aspect of layout can be altered and controlled with css,
                    thus making the task easier for a web designer. Javascript acts as the functionality when and how things should behave. Its not necesary to use javascript to make a webpage so its only there to enable interactivty.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</b>
                    <br>The browser sends a request that is following the http protocol. The server retreives it and responds using the same protocol. Without a protocol there is no way to properly communicate. Languages are a great example of this. Since
                    i dont know italian i will have a problem communicating in italy but they might know of the protocol called english which then makes it easy.

                    <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                    <br>Git again surprises me with the line cp -rvi example/report work/. It proves again and again that its a powerful tool to work with and im glad that i learn more how to use it to its potential.

                <p>
                    <b>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</b>
                    <br>Not what i can really remember. Its basically a new language for me and all prior experience with code comes from obejct oriented programming languages so i think that im kinda "locked" in my way of coding with objects and strict
                    types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</b>
                    <br>Javascript not having strict types makes it hard for me. The other languages i am familier with (java, c++) are very similar to eachother so working with javascript is a really good exercise for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</b>
                    <br>I did it mostly step by step doing all of grade 3 before starting grade 4. Parsing the json data loaded was really hard at the start. First i was thinking "how do i get the program to know this object is a json?" Typical java/c++
                    thinking. It really amazed me that i could just write, in this case, "json.Skolenheter" to access the array of schools. From there on i could google most stuff i hade problems and also looking at some of your examples. I did aim for
                    grade 5 and time wasn't really an issue this week so it was no problem working towards it. I could probably put in more time in the last part of grade 5 but it seemed like a very subjective question so im not sure when the work is
                    done for that particular assignment. The website itself is trying to be a bit minimalistic but the movable duck really takes away that. I could always put in more time when styling the webpage but for me its not really a big priority
                    and i enyoy working with functionality more rather than styling the pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                    <br>Many parts of javascript. The loose typing, how object are created and used. I really hoped that javascript would have call by reference on primitive types but that was sadly not possible. I could be just using it wrong or used
                    the wrong sentence when searching.

                <p>
                    <b>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</b>
                    <br>I had never used any of these tools before or something similar within webprogramming. I had some troubles in the start, mostly when doing the tutorial, but in the end it wasn't that complicated and i quite enjoyed working with
                    this assignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</b>
                    <br>I have really enjoyed it so far. The flexibility of javascript not needing to know what propertys exist and having this very loose structure is really growing on me. Its quite refreshing compared to java where all types needs to
                    be known or coverted to work with it. I also really like the assignment itself. Grade 4 and 5 had some useful things to learn such as being able to work with query string and params from the url aswell as learning how to use EJS. Just
                    the knowledge of knowing that these are options on how create something is really valuable and the more options i know of the better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</b>
                    <br>My plan was simply to do as much as time allows me and not stay stuck for to long with a task. I also wanted wanted to learn how to use the components and tools that the assignment tutorial used such as the EJS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</b>
                    <br>I didn't really have any aim before starting the assignment and i would just go as far as i could without getting hard stuck. In the end i only had minor blockades that i knew i could solve so it turned out to not be very difficult
                    overall. Using EJS was the only part that was tough and took quite some time to finish but it was mostly down to my own logic of creating the table rows and when the data cells should have been highlighted. It did take some trial and
                    error to acheive grade 5 but it feels like i have learnt alot from the assignments so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                    <br>Mixing javascript and html with EJS. I have done something similar before with java and jps files but i was still taken by surprise when i learned that this was an option.

                <p>
                    <b>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</b>
                    <br>Im rather neutral about this langauge. There is nothing i particularly like or dislike with it. I did however like being able to insert html through php for the header and footer so it would be updated on every page but this does
                    not feel like an exclusive thing for php. At the same time it felt quite boring to work with this assignment and im not sure if it was the php itself or the assignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</b>
                    <br>In a way its similar to javascript because of the loose typing but other than that i cannot make comparisions as i dont feel like i really know php well enough to make correct/objectiv comparisons. Still, logic works the same way
                    in all languages so this assignemtn was not really a problem and your example code helped alot. Maybe even to much as some parts felt like copy paste and voila it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</b>
                    <br>Time is valuable so i felt that i wouldnt put in too much time on this one incase i get stuck. Starting the assignment i aimed for highest grade possible but ultimately i only ended up doing the task up til grade 4 and the biggest
                    reason for this underperformance is the time commitment. I did not feel like i had the time as other assignements are approaching and exam work is also progressing. I am satisfied with the pages itself but not really with the effort
                    i put in. Could just be a temporary lack of motivation that caused some of the problems i had during this assignment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                    <br>I didnt really know how to use php before so basically everything i did with php was new. Connecting a webpage to an SQL database was very useful and is something i will most likely make use of during the project.

                <p>
                    <b>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</b>
                    <br>Java seems to still be the most popular programming language and Im glad that i got to learn it through this program at HKR but i still think its a shame that its the only programming language we delve deeper into (besides languages
                    in this course). Having some content with C++ or even start out with it instead of java would be beneficial in my opinion. I remember when in my short attendance at BTH where they used to teach Java and C++ some time after but when
                    they switched the courses they saw better results when it came to coding. In particular C++ has one aspect/concept that i think is really important/usefull to learn and that is Call by reference and the importance of addressing. Python
                    is a language that is also gaining popularity and its a language i haven't worked with yet but it will surely see increased usage as machine learning sees growth. But i wish that C++ would be more popular but its best days is most
                    likely way past it's days as simpler languages such as Java, Python are already more popular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</b>
                    <br>I have no real preference and it would all depend on what im doing and what either fits or that im comfortable with. I have never worked with functional programming so a language that forces me to work and think in that way would
                    be interesting such as purescript. At the same time i would like to work more with C++ because i dont really feel like i delved deep enough and i would especially want more practise with pointers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results. </b>
                    <br>I did a comparsion between C++, Java and Python. The filters was Worldwide, past 12 months, All categories and web searches. To my surprise Java and Python was much closer to each other than i expected and as expected C++ was very
                    much below them. Java and Python had basically the same interest until summer last year in which Python gained more interest and is consistently above Java after that time point. On average Python had a interest score of 80, Java on
                    74, C++ on 24.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</b>
                    <br>I would recommend TypeScript as typing provides more readible code and understanding of the program. It compiles down to javascript making it usable for both front and back end development. It is a very popular framework which
                    surely makes it easier to find people with experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                    <br>I didn't expect TypeScript to be such a popular framework and i reading up on TypeScript i would bet money on it being a majorly used framework in the future.

                    <b>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</b>
                    <br>.NET makes use of C# which is an object oriented language similar to Java. .NET provides a framework to create both console and web applications but its primary use is webapplications in particular. I would probably prefer this
                    framework when working on big/complex projects as .NET provides a good code structure in my opinion. It does however provide some "magic" functionality which can make it hard to know exactly how things work but its no problem in making
                    things work in my experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</b>
                    <br>When working on smaller projects i much prefer the other frameworks such as nodejs/express as i think they were simpler to use but as a project grows in size and complexity i can see why the structure of .NET could prove useful.
                    Some parts are very similar such as razor pages and EJS but the razor pages looked way nicer to work with rather than EJS. Following MVC with .NET is really useful and i dont know myself if its possible to create a similar structure
                    with js so that could be a huge positive for .NET. Googling solutions was quite a bit harder with for .NET compared to other languages/frameworks i have worked with such as when googling routing. I found 3-4 different ways to do it
                    if i remember it right so i wasn't sure if i started using 1 thing would force me to change something else and create a cascade of changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</b>
                    <br>I had no prior experience with C# or .NET at all before this assignment and i had the view that this is a framework that many companies are using so i wanted to learn a bit and not halfass it. I didn't look at any tutorial so instead
                    i only looked at your example code and learned from there. C# is quite similar to java so it wasn't really a problem. There were alot of small things i had to google and work around such as the IEnumerable type which i think was a
                    bit annoying to work with. Even though this is something i feel like i should really learn i didnt aim for grade 5 unless it was something i could do without much trouble. Exam work and the project is putting some stress on me so wanted
                    to just finish this. In the end i only finished the grade 4 task and im quite satisfied with the functionality but the navigation could probably be done in a better way as it ended up with a simple href to the api/accounts url. The
                    webapplication is tested with postman and has no html form on the page to test the api.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                    <br>I have worked with MVC before when using JavaFX and something similar called Model View ViewModel (MVVM) in android. So seing a slightly different way of doing it in .NET was quite nice however it was more difficult in .NET.

                    <b>Analysis</b>
                    <br>For this assignment, a set of tools should be used in order to evaluate the performance of a few websites. We are a group of 3, consisting of Ella Jensen, Johan Granberg and Rasmus Olsson.
                    <br><br> Link to data sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LX_dsJtw_f7RHTDO-FEdnFh1_lMa9TXuE_zeI9GH6M/edit?usp=sharin

                <p><b>1. Reddit</b></p>
                <p>
                    is a website I use everyday for a wide variety of reasons. I would describe it as a modern looking forum where you subscribe to a topic/genre eg. /r/soccer if i'm interested in soccer. I have always viewed the site to be a little slow but not at all problematic
                    so measuring it to see if it actually is slow compared to real metrics could be interesting.
                    <br><br> The measured performance turned out to be worse than I expected and some parts of the tests showed unreasonable results although that could be faulted by my understanding of the metric. Lighthouse and Pagespeed showed a similar
                    general performance score of 20 and 26 but quite different results when it gets specific. Lighthouse showed a Time to interact of 28.8 seconds while Pagespeed showed a time of 11.1 seconds. None of the results feels representative
                    of how it actually feels using the website. I would say it feels like 2-3 seconds when using it and i thought that was really slow so there might be some kind of issue when using these tools for this particular metric. Overall Pagespeed
                    gave way faster results compared to Lighthouse yet gave it a similar general score.
                    <br><br> Using the network tab i could see that it's a quite heavy site compared to the other 2 sites we analysed with up to 5 times the amount of resources received measured in MB. This is probably the result of the many images that
                    are being loaded on reddit and this is probably also the reason the site takes 24.13 seconds to finish loading the page.
                    <br><br> To speed up the page it's recommended to properly size the images which would lead to less data usage. It is also recommended to minimize main thread work but it's unclear on just how that would be done.
                    <br><br> Web Performance will always be an important part of web development and it’s something to take seriously. Web pages today are expected to be fast these days and having a slow and unresponsive experience can have a serious
                    impact on the user base.

                <p><b>2. Hltv</b></p>
                <p> I chose the website www.hltv.org. The reason being since it's a website I often use, I would say daily. I’ve noticed it can be a bit slow sometimes and It could be interesting to evaluate the performance of a website I often visit.
                    <br><br> We could say that www.hltv.org could definitely improve their performance. However, it is a bit confusing since the PageSpeed Insights score is 98 whereas the Lighthouse speed is 35. I made sure that the tests were on desktop
                    and I tested it in regular-mode and incognito-mode, still the same results. The speed index on Lighthouse was 6.8s whereas the speed index on PageSpeed Insights was 1.5s. It is a bit confusing since I don’t know which one is “correct”.
                    Time to interact was also off. On PageSpeed Insights it was 1.7s and on Lighthouse it was 9.0s. Regarding the network tabs findings, the requests was 102 which compared to the other two websites, was the lowest. The resources were
                    only 4.6 MB as well which, compared to the other websites, were the lowest. In order to load the page faster, they could properly size their images in order to save cellular data and this will improve the load time. They could also
                    eliminate render-blocking resources.
                    <br><br> Web testing is important in order to check your webpage for potential bugs before its made live and is accessible to the public. When testing performance, you test the webpages response times at different connection speeds,
                    stress test your website to determine its break point, test if a crash occurs due to peak load and also test the optimization for the browser and server side cache to reduce load times and compressions.

                <p><b>3. Stronger</b></p>
                <p> I decided to inspect the webpage www.stronger.se because a friend of mine is working with the design of that page. The overall Performance score was surprisingly low, only 14 when i did an inspection with Lighthouse and only 10 for the
                    Pagespeed Insights check.
                    <br><br> But it received 72 in score for Accessibility, 83 in score for SEO and 79 in score for Best Practices for the Lighthouse audit. Because the other scores were so high, I was surprised the overall score was so low. There are
                    more inconsistencies from these tests that confuses me, speed index for lighthouse was 7.8 and speed index from the Pagespeed Insight check was 11.4. It makes me question how accurate these “scores” are.
                    <br><br> However, the tips on how to improve the website so the “score” would be higher is interesting. I do question if it is actually needed. The website has a score of 79 for best practices. I would assume that there would be some
                    improvement if the score was 100. But how much difference would it make? One of the improvement tips was to add an alternate text to buttons. As I am quite new to web development I don't know how much this would improve the website
                    overall Performance score.
                    <br><br> The tips that Lighthouse gives about images I understand and they sound like good advice. But I don’t know if it is applicable to this website, because I think they use the bigger file format to show their product in the best
                    way.
                    <br><br> Web Performance especially for a website with an online store and with products such as fashion clothes, need to have a good looking website with good pictures but still be responsive and perform as good as possible. It may
                    not look like this webpage would perform that good but to me it feels like it is quite responsive. I have not however tried ordering clothes and using the actual webshop.

                    <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                    <br>I did not know at all about the measurement tools we used during this section and that it could show so vastly different results compared to what i myself would notice when using the sites reguarly. There probably existed some
                    problems with the tools and the particular sites but i have no clue what it could be.
