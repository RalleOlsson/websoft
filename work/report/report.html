                        <b>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</b>
                        <br>Im quite comfortable with Git and Github because we have used it for most of our projects. I myself dont really have problems with git but at times during our projects it did become troublesome. I have used built in frameworks
                        for most our projects though so its quite good that i am "forced" to use commands in git bash again. I had never heard of Markdown or github pages before and it would be nice if we make use of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Have you ever created websites before?</b>
                        <br>Only when i had a small course in it in upper secondary school. I did not particularly like it back then and i hope this course will change that. Other than that i have never continued devoloping anything web based.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</b>
                        <br>Very little experience with html, css, javascript, php coming from courses in upper secondary school. I dont remember much of it since it didnt interest me back then. If it counts i have done a fair share of styling in android
                        development which uses a tree structure like html. I have a very broad interest of IT and development in general. I like both front and back end but of the two i probably enyoy back end more but there are alot of factors involved
                        so sometimes i might enyoy doign the front end more and vice verca.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                        <br>Being able to test html through Github pages was a quite nice surprise. I had also never forked a repository before. So far i really like the way this course is setup with many mandatory tasks because otherwise i might have
                        become a bit lazy and not practise enough.

                        <b>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or Javascript?</b>
                        <br>Very little experience during my time in upper secondary school. We had a weird sitution with the teacher where he suddenly couldnt work anymore so another teacher took over and basically told us to use https://www.codecademy.com/
                        to learn. It was super boring and is the main reason i have never had any interest in web devolopment. I dont know if its bad memory but i can barely recall anything of css. The things i know now mostly comes from styling in android
                        cause it is kinda similar. This course seem much more promising so far and i enyoy it quite a bit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</b>
                        <br>HTML acts as the structure where things are placed and how you can interact with the different parts. CSS acts as the appearance that decides how things should look. Every aspect of layout can be altered and controlled with
                        css, thus making the task easier for a web designer. Javascript acts as the functionality when and how things should behave. Its not necesary to use javascript to make a webpage so its only there to enable interactivty.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</b>
                        <br>The browser sends a request that is following the http protocol. The server retreives it and responds using the same protocol. Without a protocol there is no way to properly communicate. Languages are a great example of this.
                        Since i dont know italian i will have a problem communicating in italy but they might know of the protocol called english which then makes it easy.

                        <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                        <br>Git again surprises me with the line cp -rvi example/report work/. It proves again and again that its a powerful tool to work with and im glad that i learn more how to use it to its potential.

                    <p>
                        <b>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</b>
                        <br>Not what i can really remember. Its basically a new language for me and all prior experience with code comes from obejct oriented programming languages so i think that im kinda "locked" in my way of coding with objects and
                        strict types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</b>
                        <br>Javascript not having strict types makes it hard for me. The other languages i am familier with (java, c++) are very similar to eachother so working with javascript is a really good exercise for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</b>
                        <br>I did it mostly step by step doing all of grade 3 before starting grade 4. Parsing the json data loaded was really hard at the start. First i was thinking "how do i get the program to know this object is a json?" Typical java/c++
                        thinking. It really amazed me that i could just write, in this case, "json.Skolenheter" to access the array of schools. From there on i could google most stuff i hade problems and also looking at some of your examples. I did aim
                        for grade 5 and time wasn't really an issue this week so it was no problem working towards it. I could probably put in more time in the last part of grade 5 but it seemed like a very subjective question so im not sure when the
                        work is done for that particular assignment. The website itself is trying to be a bit minimalistic but the movable duck really takes away that. I could always put in more time when styling the webpage but for me its not really
                        a big priority and i enyoy working with functionality more rather than styling the pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                        <br>Many parts of javascript. The loose typing, how object are created and used. I really hoped that javascript would have call by reference on primitive types but that was sadly not possible. I could be just using it wrong or
                        used the wrong sentence when searching.

                        <b>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</b>
                        <br>I had never used any of these tools before or something similar within webprogramming. I had some troubles in the start, mostly when doing the tutorial, but in the end it wasn't that complicated and i quite enjoyed working
                        with this assignment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</b>
                        <br>I have really enjoyed it so far. The flexibility of javascript not needing to know what propertys exist and having this very loose structure is really growing on me. Its quite refreshing compared to java where all types needs
                        to be known or coverted to work with it. I also really like the assignment itself. Grade 4 and 5 had some useful things to learn such as being able to work with query string and params from the url aswell as learning how to use
                        EJS. Just the knowledge of knowing that these are options on how create something is really valuable and the more options i know of the better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</b>
                        <br>My plan was simply to do as much as time allows me and not stay stuck for to long with a task. I also wanted wanted to learn how to use the components and tools that the assignment tutorial used such as the EJS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</b>
                        <br>I didn't really have any aim before starting the assignment and i would just go as far as i could without getting hard stuck. In the end i only had minor blockades that i knew i could solve so it turned out to not be very difficult
                        overall. Using EJS was the only part that was tough and took quite some time to finish but it was mostly down to my own logic of creating the table rows and when the data cells should have been highlighted. It did take some trial
                        and error to acheive grade 5 but it feels like i have learnt alot from the assignments so far.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                        <br>Mixing javascript and html with EJS. I have done something similar before with java and jps files but i was still taken by surprise when i learned that this was an option.

                    <p>
                        <b>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</b>
                        <br>Im rather neutral about this langauge. There is nothing i particularly like or dislike with it. I did however like being able to insert html through php for the header and footer so it would be updated on every page but this
                        does not feel like an exclusive thing for php. At the same time it felt quite boring to work with this assignment and im not sure if it was the php itself or the assignment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</b>
                        <br>In a way its similar to javascript because of the loose typing but other than that i cannot make comparisions as i dont feel like i really know php well enough to make correct/objectiv comparisons. Still, logic works the same
                        way in all languages so this assignemtn was not really a problem and your example code helped alot. Maybe even to much as some parts felt like copy paste and voila it works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</b>
                        <br>Time is valuable so i felt that i wouldnt put in too much time on this one incase i get stuck. Starting the assignment i aimed for highest grade possible but ultimately i only ended up doing the task up til grade 4 and the
                        biggest reason for this underperformance is the time commitment. I did not feel like i had the time as other assignements are approaching and exam work is also progressing. I am satisfied with the pages itself but not really with
                        the effort i put in. Could just be a temporary lack of motivation that caused some of the problems i had during this assignment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                        <br>I didnt really know how to use php before so basically everything i did with php was new. Connecting a webpage to an SQL database was very useful and is something i will most likely make use of during the project.

                    <p>
                        <b>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</b>
                        <br>Java seems to still be the most popular programming language and Im glad that i got to learn it through this program at HKR but i still think its a shame that its the only programming language we delve deeper into (besides
                        languages in this course). Having some content with C++ or even start out with it instead of java would be beneficial in my opinion. I remember when in my short attendance at BTH where they used to teach Java and C++ some time
                        after but when they switched the courses they saw better results when it came to coding. In particular C++ has one aspect/concept that i think is really important/usefull to learn and that is Call by reference and the importance
                        of addressing. Python is a language that is also gaining popularity and its a language i haven't worked with yet but it will surely see increased usage as machine learning sees growth. But i wish that C++ would be more popular
                        but its best days is most likely way past it's days as simpler languages such as Java, Python are already more popular.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</b>
                        <br>I have no real preference and it would all depend on what im doing and what either fits or that im comfortable with. I have never worked with functional programming so a language that forces me to work and think in that way
                        would be interesting such as purescript. At the same time i would like to work more with C++ because i dont really feel like i delved deep enough and i would especially want more practise with pointers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results. </b>
                        <br>I did a comparsion between C++, Java and Python. The filters was Worldwide, past 12 months, All categories and web searches. To my surprise Java and Python was much closer to each other than i expected and as expected C++ was
                        very much below them. Java and Python had basically the same interest until summer last year in which Python gained more interest and is consistently above Java after that time point. On average Python had a interest score of 80,
                        Java on 74, C++ on 24.

                        <b>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</b>
                        <br>I would recommend TypeScript as typing provides more readible code and understanding of the program. It compiles down to javascript making it usable for both front and back end development. It is a very popular framework which
                        surely makes it easier to find people with experience.

                        <br>I didn't expect TypeScript to be such a popular framework and i reading up on TypeScript i would bet money on it being a majorly used framework in the future.

                        <b>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</b>
                        <br>.NET makes use of C# which is an object oriented language similar to Java. .NET provides a framework to create both console and web applications but its primary use is webapplications in particular. I would probably prefer
                        this framework when working on big/complex projects as .NET provides a good code structure in my opinion. It does however provide some "magic" functionality which can make it hard to know exactly how things work but its no problem
                        in making things work in my experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</b>
                        <br>When working on smaller projects i much prefer the other frameworks such as nodejs/express as i think they were simpler to use but as a project grows in size and complexity i can see why the structure of .NET could prove useful.
                        Some parts are very similar such as razor pages and EJS but the razor pages looked way nicer to work with rather than EJS. Following MVC with .NET is really useful and i dont know myself if its possible to create a similar structure
                        with js so that could be a huge positive for .NET. Googling solutions was quite a bit harder with for .NET compared to other languages/frameworks i have worked with such as when googling routing. I found 3-4 different ways to do
                        it if i remember it right so i wasn't sure if i started using 1 thing would force me to change something else and create a cascade of changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</b>
                        <br>I had no prior experience with C# or .NET at all before this assignment and i had the view that this is a framework that many companies are using so i wanted to learn a bit and not halfass it. I didn't look at any tutorial
                        so instead i only looked at your example code and learned from there. C# is quite similar to java so it wasn't really a problem. There were alot of small things i had to google and work around such as the IEnumerable type which
                        i think was a bit annoying to work with. Even though this is something i feel like i should really learn i didnt aim for grade 5 unless it was something i could do without much trouble. Exam work and the project is putting some
                        stress on me so wanted to just finish this. In the end i only finished the grade 4 task and im quite satisfied with the functionality but the navigation could probably be done in a better way as it ended up with a simple href to
                        the api/accounts url. The webapplication is tested with postman and has no html form on the page to test the api.
