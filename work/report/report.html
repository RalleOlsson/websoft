                        <b>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</b>
                        <br>Im quite comfortable with Git and Github because we have used it for most of our projects. I myself dont really have problems with git but at times during our projects it did become troublesome. I have used built in frameworks
                        for most our projects though so its quite good that i am "forced" to use commands in git bash again. I had never heard of Markdown or github pages before and it would be nice if we make use of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Have you ever created websites before?</b>
                        <br>Only when i had a small course in it in upper secondary school. I did not particularly like it back then and i hope this course will change that. Other than that i have never continued devoloping anything web based.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</b>
                        <br>Very little experience with html, css, javascript, php coming from courses in upper secondary school. I dont remember much of it since it didnt interest me back then. If it counts i have done a fair share of styling in android
                        development which uses a tree structure like html. I have a very broad interest of IT and development in general. I like both front and back end but of the two i probably enyoy back end more but there are alot of factors involved
                        so sometimes i might enyoy doign the front end more and vice verca.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                        <br>Being able to test html through Github pages was a quite nice surprise. I had also never forked a repository before. So far i really like the way this course is setup with many mandatory tasks because otherwise i might have
                        become a bit lazy and not practise enough.

                    <p>
                        <b>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or Javascript?</b>
                        <br>Very little experience during my time in upper secondary school. We had a weird sitution with the teacher where he suddenly couldnt work anymore so another teacher took over and basically told us to use https://www.codecademy.com/
                        to learn. It was super boring and is the main reason i have never had any interest in web devolopment. I dont know if its bad memory but i can barely recall anything of css. The things i know now mostly comes from styling in android
                        cause it is kinda similar. This course seem much more promising so far and i enyoy it quite a bit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</b>
                        <br>HTML acts as the structure where things are placed and how you can interact with the different parts. CSS acts as the appearance that decides how things should look. Every aspect of layout can be altered and controlled with
                        css, thus making the task easier for a web designer. Javascript acts as the functionality when and how things should behave. Its not necesary to use javascript to make a webpage so its only there to enable interactivty.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</b>
                        <br>The browser sends a request that is following the http protocol. The server retreives it and responds using the same protocol. Without a protocol there is no way to properly communicate. Languages are a great example of this.
                        Since i dont know italian i will have a problem communicating in italy but they might know of the protocol called english which then makes it easy.

                    <p>
                        <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                        <br>Git again surprises me with the line cp -rvi example/report work/. It proves again and again that its a powerful tool to work with and im glad that i learn more how to use it to its potential.

                    <p>
                        <b>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</b>
                        <br>Not what i can really remember. Its basically a new language for me and all prior experience with code comes from obejct oriented programming languages so i think that im kinda "locked" in my way of coding with objects and
                        strict types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</b>
                        <br>Javascript not having strict types makes it hard for me. The other languages i am familier with (java, c++) are very similar to eachother so working with javascript is a really good exercise for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</b>
                        <br>I did it mostly step by step doing all of grade 3 before starting grade 4. Parsing the json data loaded was really hard at the start. First i was thinking "how do i get the program to know this object is a json?" Typical java/c++
                        thinking. It really amazed me that i could just write, in this case, "json.Skolenheter" to access the array of schools. From there on i could google most stuff i hade problems and also looking at some of your examples. I did aim
                        for grade 5 and time wasn't really an issue this week so it was no problem working towards it. I could probably put in more time in the last part of grade 5 but it seemed like a very subjective question so im not sure when the
                        work is done for that particular assignment. The website itself is trying to be a bit minimalistic but the movable duck really takes away that. I could always put in more time when styling the webpage but for me its not really
                        a big priority and i enyoy working with functionality more rather than styling the pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
                        <br>Many parts of javascript. The loose typing, how object are created and used. I really hoped that javascript would have call by reference on primitive types but that was sadly not possible. I could be just using it wrong or
                        used the wrong sentence when searching.
