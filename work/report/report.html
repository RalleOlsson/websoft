                Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
                Im quite comfortable with Git and Github because we have used it for most of our projects. I had never
                heard of Markdown or github pages before.

                Have you ever created websites before?
                Only when i had a small course in it in upper secondary school. I did not particularly like it back then
                and i hope this course will change that.
                Other than that i have never continued devoloping anything web based.

                Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
                Very little experince with html, css, javascript, php coming from courses in upper secondary school. I
                dont remember much of it since it didnt interest me back then.

                What is your TIL for this course section?
                Being able to test html through Github pages was a quite nice surprise.
