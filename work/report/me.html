<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>So, a presentation might be in order. I'll begin.</p>

<p>My name is Rasmus Olsson, born and raised in Osby, Skåne, 40 min away from kristianstad. I liked to play fotball when i was younger but stopped at 18 years old.</p>

<p>computers has always been an interest of mine, ever since I was 7 years old and i started specializing in IT in upper secondary school and led to more studies here at HKR</p>
